                                # Counting 

"""
Background: 
    To solidify for strings and indexing, weâ€™re going to create a program that 
    asks the user for a string as input and calculates the number of words and 
    characters present in the string.

    Create a program called count.py that asks the user for a string. 
    Then, use a for loop to go through each character of the string and keep counters
    for the number of words and characters.  


Example Runs:
    $ python count.py

    Enter string: Hello world

    Number of words in the string:

    2

    Number of characters in the string:

    11

    

    $ python count.py

    Enter string: I love python

    Number of words in the string:

    3

    Number of characters in the string:

    13
