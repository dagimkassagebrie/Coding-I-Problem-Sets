# Goal: Create a program that calculates the score of a quidditch match.

"""
Background: 
    You want to calculate the final score for a team that has just participated 
    in an exciting quidditch match using a program called quidditch.py. If you 
    don’t know about quidditch… Recall that each “goal” in quidditch is worth 
    10 points, and that catching the snitch is worth 150 points.

Your Mission: 
    Building on the code in quidditch.py, implement a function that takes two 
    variables as input — an int indicating the number of times the team got the 
    Quaffle through the other team’s hoops, and an int indicating whether or not 
    they caught the snitch – and returns that team’s final score (what would the return type be?).
